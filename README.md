Currently, my site has four pages:

## Home
This page will have a basic bio and will help a visitor navigate to other important pages on my site. 

## About 
Includes basic info about me, a more detailed bio, my education, etc. 

## CV
This page has a download feature to see a paper version of my 1 page resume. I'll also have my CV on the page (with extended information beyond my 1-page resume).

## Portfolio
The big reason I'm making this! This section has drop down sections where readers can learn more about projects I've been part of. Clicking will provide info in the format of my paper portfolio "I learned, I was responible for, etc.."


Layouts for each page can be found in the ```_layouts``` folder. Right now, all pages inherit from ```default.html```
