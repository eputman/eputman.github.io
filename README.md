Currently, my site has four pages:

## Home
This page will have a basic bio and will help a visitor navigate to other important pages on my site. 
To do:
- Fixed sidebar creation. I'd like this to appear on all pages.

## About 
Includes basic info about me, a more detailed bio, my education, etc. 

## CV
Still deciding whether to do a markdown CV or just include a static image of my current resume. 

## Portfolio
The big reason I'm making this! Hopefully this will be a grid of project images with hover-initiated titles. Clicking will provide info in the format of my paper portfolio "I learned, I was responible for, etc.."


Layouts for each page can be found in the ```_layouts``` folder. Right now, all pages inherit from ```default```
