### eputman.github.io

I made this personal website to create an online platform for my portfolio and resume. In taking on this project, I also wanted to gain skills in HTML and CSS, two languages I rarely need to work with but are indisputably valuable. To do so, I chose to build a site from scratch, rather than use an interface like Wordpress. This site was also made while I was very new to GitHub (as evident by the less-than-desirable commit and merge practices used here). 

Working on this site, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. It took a bit of trial and error, but I learned how to reference style sheets and use CSS elements for creating a usable site. I made sure that the formatting, spacing, and construction translated to phones screens and displays of various widths. I learned how to make simple interactable elements using just HTML and CSS, like my Portfolio project pages that you can swipe through with a touchscreen, scrollbar, or by clicking the number icons at the top of the page. 

Overall, I want this website to serve a functional purpose of communicating about me, my passions, and my experience to potential employers. Laerning along the way was an added bonus, and I felt a great sense of accomplishment once the site was completed and operational!

Next step: grabbing a custom domain name.
